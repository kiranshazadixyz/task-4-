            <p>My favorite cartoon character is cookie, and my favorite dessert is cupcakes. So Cookie Cupcakes are best of both the worlds. Did you see the awesome ones Asha said, <span class="quote">"Sometimes I think cookies are too hard, and sometimes I think cake is too soft. You know what is just right? Cookie cupcakes for the win."</span> :) I wonder if she can taste the apples for the cupcakes? If so, I want to know (and I can love ANYONE)!</p>
